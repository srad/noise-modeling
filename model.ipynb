    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "EMVA launched the initiative to define a unified method to measure, compute and present specification parameters for cameras and image sensors used for machine vision applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Choosing the suitable camera for a given machine vision application often proves to be a challenging task. The data sheets provided by the manufacturers are difficult to compare. Frequently, vital pieces of information are not available and the user is forced to conduct a costly comparative test which still may fail to deliver all relevant camera parameters. This is where the EMVA 1288 Standard comes in. It creates transparency by defining reliable and exact measurement procedures as well as data presentation guidelines and makes the comparison of cameras and image sensors much easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Standard is elaborated by a consortium of the industry leading sensor and camera manufacturers, distributers and component customers. The Standard is organized in a modular approach. The first module was officially released by the working group member companies in August 2005.\n",
